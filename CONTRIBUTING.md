# Contributing Guidelines

## Workflow

1. Create an issue describing the task or stage.
2. Create a branch from the issue (e.g. `stage2-ml-design`).
3. Work on your branch and commit regularly.
4. Push your branch to GitHub.
5. Open a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch.
6. Request a review and merge once approved.

## Branch Naming

- Use `stageX-taskname` format (e.g., `stage2-ml-design`)
