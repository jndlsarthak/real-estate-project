# Residual Analysis Summary
## Residuals vs Predicted Price :

- The residuals (differences between actual and predicted prices) are spread fairly randomly around zero for most predicted price values.

- There is no clear pattern or structure, which suggests the model is not missing any obvious trends.

- However, there are some large residuals (outliers), especially for higher predicted prices, indicating occasional substantial over- or under-predictions.

## Residual Distribution :

- The histogram of residuals shows a strong peak at zero, meaning most predictions are close to the true values.

- The distribution is roughly symmetric but slightly skewed and has a few large residuals on both sides, reflecting outliers.

- Most residuals cluster tightly near zero, suggesting the model is reasonably accurate for the majority of the data.

## Conclusion
- The model generally predicts well, but there are some extreme errors (outliers).

- No major bias or trend remains, as residuals are spread around zero with no systematic pattern.

- Mild skew and outliers are present, which is common in real estate data due to occasional atypical properties or data anomalies.
